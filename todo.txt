ComponentManager: 1. finish signatureCallPairFunction() to concatenate two tuples
		     and call function.
		  2. implement find by signature method that returns id and then
		     implement forEntity(Id) that does specified function only
		     for entity with id thus having constant complexity. Used for singleton components(input)
		  3. decide how players will be drawn and finish graphics
		  4. Implement System and component for menu controll etc. on client side
		  5. Merge server and client from other branch with existing network clases
		  6. implement game logic on server, such as starting a game and handling goal situations etc.
